 				WeightedROF.c (MEX version) by Tom Goldstein
 
  This code performs weighted isotropic ROF denoising using the "Split Bregman" algorithm.
 This version of the code has a "mex" interface, and should be compiled and called
 through MATLAB.

DISCLAIMER:  This code is for academic (non-commercial) use only.  Also, this code 
comes with absolutely NO warranty of any kind: I do my best to write reliable codes, 
but I take no responsibility for the reliability of the results.

                      HOW TO COMPILE THIS CODE
   To compile this code, open a MATLAB terminal, and change the current directory to
the folder where this "c" file is contained.  Then, enter this command:
    >>  mex WeightedROF.c
This file has been tested under windows using lcc, and under SUSE Unix using gcc.
Once the file is compiled, the command "WeightedROF" can be used just like any
other MATLAB m-file.

                      HOW TO USE THIS CODE
 An image is denoised using the following command
 
   WeightedROF(image,weights,mu,tol);

 where:
   - "image" is a 2d array containing the noisy image.
   - "weights" is the 2d array of weights at each pixel.  Use "ones(rows,cols)"
               to get standard ROF denoising. 
   - "mu" is the weighting parameter for the fidelity term 
            (usually a value between 0.01 and 0.5 works well for images with 
                           pixels on the 0-255 scale).
   - "tol" is the stopping tolerance for the iteration.  "tol"=0.001 is reasonable for
            most applications.
