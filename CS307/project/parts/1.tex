% # Suggested Steps
% Find some data for experiments. You can use all ﬁlms with titles, directors, actors and other related information. Some other data such as 'Infected cases by COVID-19', 'Stock data', 'Library data' etc. is also ﬁne. But the size should be reasonably large.
% Store the data into a database table. Then use select in SQL to ﬁnd the ﬁlms with word "XXX" in titles, and record the execution time.
% Store the data into a ﬁle, and then load it into RAM. The data in RAM can be any format you preferred. Design an algorithm to search "XXX" in titles. Record the execution time of your algorithm.
% Some other comparisons and experiments you would like to do. Such as you can reorganize data into some other format for faster retrieval. You are recommended to study the mechanism of DMBS for storing and retrieval
%
% # Basic Requirements
% 1. Clearly and easy understanding design.
% 2. You need to show that you really do the experiments by some experimental details and reasonable analysis.
%
% # Bonus
% 1. High concurrency and transaction management
% 2. User privileges management
% 3. Database index and ﬁle IO
% 4. Large data sets (the data is large enough and cannot be stored into RAM)
% 5. Compare performance of multiple databases with ﬁle system over diﬀerent operation systems
