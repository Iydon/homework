\section{Conclusions and Discussions}\label{S:conclusions}
From this article, we introduce projectile motion and quadratic equation through a real world problem --- \emph{what angle should we throw a football for maximum range}, then we give a proper and accurate definition of quadratic equation, from which we derive quadratic formula for solving quadratic equations. Furthermore, we list some useful applications of the quadratic equation and implement them in \texttt{Python}.
